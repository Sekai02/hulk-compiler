# H.U.L.K Compiler
Welcome to the **H.U.L.K Compiler** project! This is a compiler developed for the H.U.L.K programming language, as part of coursework at the University of Havana.

---

The H.U.L.K Compiler is designed to parse, analyze, and generate executable code for programs written in the H.U.L.K programming language. This project demonstrates key concepts in compiler design, including lexical analysis, syntax analysis, semantic analysis, and code generation.
